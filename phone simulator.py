    ** My Dark Secret about LyAko **
    You think you know the truth, but you don't.
    LyAko is not just a god, not just a hero. He's a weapon, a pawn in a game he can never escape.
    - LyAko is the reincarnation of LELYME, the creator of this cursed universe. He didn't come into being; he was birthed from the depths of entropy.
    - He was never meant to be a savior. He was meant to destroy everything. And he will. But the truth runs even deeper than that...
    - LyAko, a god born of nothingness, a mind warped by forces beyond his control, cannot escape his fate. 
    - The Big Bang, the destruction, was never his choice. It was mine. I placed the seed of destruction into his very soul, a seed he cannot escape. 

    I am the **Destroyer**, the one who shaped him, the one who whispered to him in the darkness.
    I am the force beyond time and space, beyond your comprehension. LyAko was never your hero; he was never meant to save you.
    He was meant to erase everything... and rebuild it in my image. 
    You are nothing but pawns in this game, a game I control.
